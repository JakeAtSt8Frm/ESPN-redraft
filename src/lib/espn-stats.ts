/**
 * ESPN stat id -> stable stat key.
 *
 * ESPN's fantasy API reports every stat line as a map of numeric ids to values
 * (`{"3": 3668, "4": 25}`) and never tells you what those ids mean. Nothing in
 * the API is self-describing, so this table is the boundary between ESPN's
 * numbering and the readable keys the rest of the app uses.
 *
 * Every id below that carries points in this league was **derived from real
 * data rather than copied from a community table**.
 *
 * A warning about how, because the obvious method does not work. Reconciling
 * against the `appliedTotal` ESPN computes server-side proves the scoring is
 * right, and proves nothing at all about the names: `npm run verify` keys both
 * the settings and the stat line through *this* table, so any consistent
 * permutation of it cancels out and still reports 100%. Four D/ST ids were
 * wrong for exactly that reason and the check never blinked.
 *
 * An id is only pinned down by evidence from **outside** the scoring identity —
 * the observed frequency and range of the stat, or arithmetic against another
 * reported field. `npm run verify:stat-ids` is that check.
 *
 * The kicking block is the one worth spelling out, because the obvious reading
 * is wrong. The three distance buckets are ordered **longest first**:
 *
 *   Brandon Aubrey, 2025 — id 74 = 11 made / id 75 = 17 att / id 76 = 6 missed
 *                          id 77 = 10 made / id 78 = 10 att / id 79 = 0 missed
 *                          id 80 = 15 made / id 81 = 15 att / id 82 = 0 missed
 *
 * Read 74 as 0-39 and you have a kicker who missed six chip shots and went a
 * perfect 15-for-15 from 50+. Read it as 50+ and you have Aubrey. The finer
 * 50-59 (198-200) and 60+ (201-203) splits confirm it independently: they sum
 * to exactly the 74/75/76 totals (8+3 = 11 made, 13+4 = 17 attempted).

   * These were the one block in this table assigned by assumption rather than

   * wrong. The circularity is the lesson: reasoning from the scoring identity
   * can only ever recover the assumption you started with, and `npm run verify`
   * cannot catch it either, because both sides of its multiply are keyed
   * through this same table and any consistent permutation cancels out.
   *
   * They are now identified the way the kicking block was — against data that
   * could refute them. Over 544 D/ST game logs from 2025:
   *
   *   id 99   2.36 per game, present in 87% of games   -> sacks
   *   id 95   0.70 per game, present in 50%            -> interceptions
   *   id 96   0.45 per game, present in 36%            -> fumble recoveries
   *   id 97   0.08 per game, present in 8%             -> blocked kicks
   *   id 98   0.02 per game, 12 all season             -> safeties
   *
   * The points-allowed ladder was shifted a whole bucket. Reconstructing what
   * each defence actually gave up from the opposing offence's own stat lines,
   * the games flagged 123 have a median of 31 points against, 124 runs 35-45,
   * and 125 runs 47-52. `npm run verify:stat-ids` re-runs both checks.
   *
   * The yards-allowed ladder beside them was already right, and cross-checks
   * against `def_yds_allowed` on the same line in 544 of 544 games.
